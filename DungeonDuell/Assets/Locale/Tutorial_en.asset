      on the map. \n\nEach card adds rooms whcih are filled with Enemies, Loot and
      other things\n\nYou can open up paths, place buffs, or sabotage your opponents,

      the created dungeon, gather resources, and prepare for the final duel.\nAs
      you move through the dungeon, you\u2019ll collect coins, defeat enemies, and
      search for powerful upgrades.\nWith enough coins, you can improve your stats
      and customize your build.\n"

      players are automatically returned to the card phase.\nThe larger the dungeon
      you built, the more time you\u2019ll have to explore. \nUse every second wisely
      because what you collect carries over into the next round!\n\nAt the end, players
      face each other in a duel.\nYour mask, collected items, and skill determine
      whether you win or lose.\nRemember: what you set up during the card phase can
      shape your chances in battle."
